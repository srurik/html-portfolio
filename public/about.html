<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My philosophy always involved taking action and choosing the best route to take when things get tough. This mentality was strengthened by my experience in dealing with difficulties in the past.</p>

<p>After the revolution in Slovakia, I left my country in search of a better life. I was 18 years old at that time. travelled across Europe, encountered several challenges but one thing remained in my mind – to stay strong and to never give up.</p>

<p>My exposure to various cultures enabled me to have a better understanding of the people around me. It also allowed me to welcome diversity, thus inspired me to learn several languages to connect with the world more. I am conversant in English, German, Italian, Polish, Slovakian, Czech and a little bit of Bulgarian and Russian. Now, at 52 years old, I can confidently say that I’m rich in experience and possess a greater understanding of life than what I knew when I first left my home country. Life has become an excellent teacher to me.</p>

After living in most European countries, in 2010, I settled in Germany.
